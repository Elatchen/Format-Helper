# Format-Helper
This .bat file will let you select a disk which it then clears, partitions and formats. You can select between diffrent filesystems and quick or full format.

Be extra careful and double-check what you select, as it might delete data you don't want to delete if you are careless.

.bat creates a temp file while running and deletes it once finished. .bat will ask for elevated privileges.
